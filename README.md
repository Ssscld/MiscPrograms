# MiscPrograms

This folder is meant to have a random collection of algorithms and programs. These are problems / programming challenges I found on the web and sought to solve using python (Primarily). 

As far as possible, this file will have an index of programs, running instructions and dependencies. There will be a brief description of the problem - any reference to a detailed description will be provided either as a separate file or as a link in the comments of the program. 

1. #### Amazon Warmup problem. ####
  Rather simple problem - there are a bunch of stair cases and the algo has to count the number of ways to reach the top. The task is to write a function num_ways(N, X) where N is the number of staircases and X is a list of steps-at-a-time allowed. You can use any combination of steps in X to reach the top. In the simple version of the problem, X is a single no and the list of step includes all integers from {1...N}. In the twist, the list is explicitly specified eg - [1,3,5] (you cannot use 2,4 steps)

##2. Google Code Jam ## 

The problems below are from [Google's Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/) website. The code jam is organized every year over several rounds and I have created the text/doc version of the problem description in a separate document.
